How does Driverless AI detect a shift in distribution between the training, validation or testing datasets?
{
    ~ By building a model on each feature
    = By predicting which dataset a row of data belongs to
    ~ By using a binomial model
    ~ By using AUC score

//::question_08::
In time series experiments, what happens to rows with missing values in the target column during training in DAI?
{
    ~ They are imputed with zero values.
    = They are dropped from the training dataset.

    = Use of Single model in final pipeline
    ~ Use of 5-fold repeated CV
    ~ 3 Models stacking
    ~ All of the above
    ~ None of the above
}

//::question_11::
What is the role of "Unavailable Columns at prediction time"
{
    ~ Create predictions (forecasts) for columns unavailable at prediction time
    ~ Perform Refitting of the time-series model using the unavailable columns once they are available
    = Generate lag features of such columns and use during the training process
    ~ Perform interaction feature engineering of these columns with existing time columns
}

    ~ None of the Above
    = A, B, C, D
    ~ A, B, C
    ~ B, C, D
    ~ B, C
}

//::question_13::
What best describes the genetic algorithm in Driverless AI?
{
    ~ the process of feature generation using automatic techniques
    ~ the process of random selection where the best individuals are dropped in each iteration
    = the process of natural selection where the best models are selected to produce offspring models
    ~ the process of tuning the final model after evaluating a leaderboard of all models trained
}

//::question_14::
